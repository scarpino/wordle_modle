## Code for playing Wordle using network models

https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/

### Running the code
1. Create a directory in the repo root called "network" 
2. Run scripts/build_net.R (this creates a pretty big network object, so make sure it's added to .gitignore)
3. Run play_wordle.R (this works best from RStudio as it doesn't save or plot any output).

### Acknowledgements
I have nothing to do with the game Wordle. Please give all credit to its amazing creator.
